##About Oregon Dog Political Action Committee

Founded by Ron and Gail Murray in 2009 to support political candidates that work for the humane treatment of our companion pets.

Gail, a graduate of Oregon State, spent 30 years teaching children 1st-4th in Portland Public Schools.  The value of nature and animals was always a critical part of her curriculum.  As part of the Dog PAC philosophy of respect for animals, Gail believes that organized religion needs to take a more active role in teaching, and following, doctrine.

Ron has a Master's degree from Lewis and Clark in public administration and has written major legislation regarding public safety and workers rights.
