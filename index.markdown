## Oregon Dog Political Action Committee

We represent all of the needs of our animal friends, not just the headline grabbing
issues.  Animal rescue groups do a phenomenal job but just don't have the capability to change the root causes of  many of our regions animal abuse problems.  Cities all across America have embraced the no-kill agenda, including Los Angeles, Austin, and Reno!  Why can't Portland?

Our elected leaders understand the power of voters who unite -- using their voices and pocket books.  We hope you will join us in fighting for animals.  You are the key to their success.
