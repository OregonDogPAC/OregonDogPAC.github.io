			<h2>Giving Companion Pets A Voice</h2>
			<p>
				<strong>OREGON DOG Political Action Committee</strong>
				supports political candidates that work for the humane treatment of our companion pets.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Through our tax system, the State of Oregon gives each tax-paying Oregonian a $50 gift.</strong> But you can't just put it in your pocket. Instead, you must either pay it back in state taxes &mdash; <em>or donate it to a qualified campaign.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				To put it another way: By donating $50 to the OREGON DOG Political Action Committee, you can reduce your taxes or increase your refund by that same $50! That's right: <em>it's a full 100% credit</em>, not a deduction. <strong>It won't cost you a dime!</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong><em>Married, filing jointly?</em></strong> It's $50 per person - so you and your spouse can donate $100 and get it all back - and your money will go to fight for the rights of animals and help to pass laws which fight against animal abuse and cruelty.
